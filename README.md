<h2>Red Teaming</h2>
<p>
Completing the "Red Teaming" pathway has equipped me with the skills and knowledge to emulate potential adversary attacks in complex environments. Going beyond traditional penetration testing, I've learned how to conduct successful Red Team engagements and challenge the defense capabilities of my clients many diverse lab environments. The path covered essential components of Red Teaming, from threat intelligence to operational security (OPSEC) and command and control (C2) systems. I delved into techniques for gaining initial access, post-compromise actions, host and network security evasion, and exploiting Active Directory networks. With these skills, I am well-prepared to partake in Red Teaming engagements.

<h2>Web Fundamentals</h2>
<p>
The "Web Fundamentals" learning path has equipped me with knowledge and skills needed to effectively target web applications. This path has provided a foundational understanding of how web applications operate, the use of industry-standard tools for engaging with web application targets, the comprehension and exploitation of prevalent web vulnerabilities, and practical application of this expertise. I've gained insights into the underlying functions of the World Wide Web, explored common web application vulnerabilities, and achieved proficiency in using Burp Suite for web application hacking.
